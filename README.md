ASR experimenting with Neural Networks using TIMIT dataset
=====================================================================================

This repository contains experimental code implementing CNNs for ASR tests based on TIMIT resources. Because of copyright restrictions TIMIT data are not included here. In order to experiment with TIMIT dataset raw data must bu purchased from LDC. The project is mainly aimed on experimenting with CLARIN-PL resources for Polish language, but the data preparation procedure can be easily adopted to TIMIT data structure. For more information read README file in master branch.
